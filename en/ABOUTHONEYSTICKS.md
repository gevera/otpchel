## ABOUT HONEY STICKS

Honey sticks are plastic straws filled with natural honey. Each straw sealed at both ends contains about one teaspoon of honey. This is about 20 calories of energy. Honey, rich in antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, helps strengthen the immune system.

To enjoy a healthy dessert, just bite or cut the stick with scissors. Here are just a few examples when and where you can treat yourself with honey from straws:
